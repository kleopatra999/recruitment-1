# Expense Tracker

Write a simple expenses tracker application
 
 - The user must be able to create an account and log in.
 
 - When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
 
 - Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
 
- When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment

- User can filter expenses.

- User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.

- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.

- I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.

- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication

- You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.

- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc for this purpose.

- Unit and e2e tests!

- You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesnâ€™t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 1 week from today.
